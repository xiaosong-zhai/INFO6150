                    They’re the boss
                </h2>

                <h3>
                    No matter what your cat wants (or does not want), they make sure you know it. Head scratch? They’ll stick their head right under your hand. Hungry? They’ll meow loudly while standing over an empty food dish until you pause Netflix and come to see what’s up.<br>
                    Ready to play at 4 am? Zooooooooom! Your sleep schedule doesn’t matter to them. Cats are some of the most independent creatures, and they have us humans well-trained to take care of their every desire.<br>
                    Bugs? Rodents? Flying feather wand? Your cat is always on pawtrol, looking out to make sure your house is safe from anything that might be dangerous (like that sock you left hanging off the side of the hamper. Got it!). Hopefully, they won’t share their late night prey with you. No one should experience that before coffee.

                    Their perfect purrs & magnificent meows
                </h2>

                <h3>
                    Feeling blue? You can always depend on your cat to curl up with you and share their love. You’ll be quickly rewarded with a purr or a nuzzle. Their meows will alert you to anything urgent that needs to be tended to, and eventually you’ll figure out what they are trying to say. They have their own language (and we all know that most cat owners talk back to their cats. Who’s the best kitty?)<br>
                    Also, if you’re at work or your kitty is busy with their scratching post at the moment, you should check out Purl, a cat purr generator that you can customize to your exact purr requirements.
