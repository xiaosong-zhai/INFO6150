                <p> This is Jello or Jelly, he is a lively and cute Pembroke Welsh Corgi and almost 3 years old now.Eating and sleeping are his hobbiesThe word corgi has different meanings. It is Celtic for "dog" or cor for "dwarf" and gi for "dog."</p>
                <p> Pembroke Welsh corgis are known for their quick intelligence and forceful will. They are active, animated dogs and do not ever want to be left out of the action. In their own minds, they are big dogs in small bodies.
                    Corgis can be prone to excessive alarm barking and to digging or chewing if left alone too much or not exercised enough. They want to be part of the family and do not do well left in kennels. Most corgis are fine with other pets and children if they have been raised with them. Beware that they will sometimes chase and nip at the heels of small running children because of their herding instincts.
                </p>
                <p> Pembroke Welsh Corgis are known to be very friendly and energetic dogs, with a large-dog mentality in a medium-sized body. They are very eager to please, so they enjoy training and learning new things.
